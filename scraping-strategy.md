General Strategy:

1. Have seed page (http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/)
2. Visit every theme page from that seed page
   A. http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentytwelve
   From that page...
   Download the zip file


create a function for each purpose.

-- createThemeDir()
-- themeListPageToListOfThemeURLs( e.g., take in step (1) and produce urls for step (2))
-- themePageToZipLink
-- downloadZipLink(url, intoDirectory) -> downloads

Make the code able to know how to skip things it's alread done.




desired end goal:

- all the zip files in theme data directory
