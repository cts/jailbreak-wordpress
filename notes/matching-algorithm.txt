Inputs:
  * HTML Document
  * JSON Document, with values matching the HTML document
  * CTS file with unbound references into the HTML Document

Task:
  * Re-bind the CTS selectors to XPATH

Expected Twist:
  * Inline-output of variables from Wordpress will conflate
    JSON values inside large plaintext blobs. So we'll need to have meta-tags,
    like XXXtag1XXX to search for. Then, in pre-processing, we'll bump those to
    their own <span>
